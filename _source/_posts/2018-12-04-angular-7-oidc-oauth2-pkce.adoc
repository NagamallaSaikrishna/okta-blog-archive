Angular 7 was released earlier this quarter and I'm pumped about a few of its features.

[optimize for keywords]

Before I dive into showing you how to build an Angular app with authn/authz, let's take a look at what's new and noteworthy in this release.

== What's New in Angular 7

Refer to a good article, summarize the top 4-5 features.

Highlight security-related features from official release notes.

Add another feature that looks interesting.

== Create a Secure Angular Application

Angular CLI

How to install

Create an app

== Add Identity and Authentication with OIDC

Using the same username and password for all your users is silly. Since friends don't let friends write authentication, I'll show you how to use Okta for auth with just a few lines of code.

OIDC requires an identity provider (or IdP). There are many well-known IdPs like Google, Twitter, and Facebook, but those services don't allow you to manage your users like you would in Active Directory. Okta allows this, _and_ you can use Okta's API for OIDC.

https://developer.okta.com/signup/[Register for a forever-free developer account], and when you're done, come on back so you can learn more about how to secure your Spring Boot app!

=== Create an OIDC App in Okta

Log in to your Okta Developer account and navigate to **Applications** > **Add Application**. Click **Web** and click **Next**. Give the app a name you'll remember, and specify `http://localhost:4200` as a Login redirect URI. Click **Done**. The result should look something like the screenshot below.

//image::{% asset_path 'blog/angular-7/okta-oidc-app.png' %}[alt=Okta OIDC App,width=700,align=center]

Copy and paste the URI of your default authorization server and client ID into `src/app.module.ts`.

=== Use Auth Code Flow

https://github.com/manfredsteyer/angular-oauth2-oidc/issues/19

According the new OAuth2 draft spec implicit flow MUST NOT be used any more for SPA
tools.ietf.org/html/draft-parecki-oauth-browser-based-apps-00#section-7.8

https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-oauth2-oidc-codeflow

https://github.com/manfredsteyer/angular-oauth2-oidc/issues/470

=== Use AppAuth-JS

=== Okta's Angular SDK and PKCE


== Limiting Access Based on Group


To use these annotations in your app, you'll need to add a "groups" claim to your ID token.  Log in to your Okta account, navigate to **API** > **Authorization Servers**, click the **Authorization Servers** tab and edit the default one. Click the **Claims** tab and **Add Claim**. Name it "groups", and include it in the ID Token. Set the value type to "Groups" and set the filter to be a Regex of `.*`.

Now you can create an Angular directive to show/hide information. Point to issue.

== Control Access to Routes with an AuthGuard

== Angular CLI Tutorial and Spring Boot

I updated a few of my tutorials to use Angular 7 recently.

I enjoyed playing with Angular 7 so much, I turned it into a screencast!

== JHipster and Angular 7

Earlier I mentioned https://www.jhipster.tech[JHipster]. The JHipster team updated to Angular 7 in its https://www.jhipster.tech/2018/11/02/jhipster-release-5.6.0.html[5.6.0 release]. You can create a JHipster app with Angular using a single JDL file. JDL stands for [JHipster Domain Language](https://www.jhipster.tech/jdl/).

If you've never heard of JHipster before, you should download the https://www.infoq.com/minibooks/jhipster-mini-book-5[free JHipster Mini-Book] from InfoQ! It's a book I wrote to help you get started with hip technologies today: Angular, Bootstrap and Spring Boot. The 5.0 version was http://www.jhipster-book.com/#!/news/entry/jhipster-mini-book-v5-now-available[just released].
